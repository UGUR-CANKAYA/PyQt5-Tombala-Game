# PyQt5-Tombala-Game
A Tombala Game designed with Python and Qt Designer.

The game will be played with two players. For each player, you have to design a player card. In
the card, there are 3 sets of 5 numbers. For each set, the numbers must be in ascending order. The
numbers of a player card must be unique and selected randomly between 1 and 90. At the beginning, the
player cards must be empty. When the “Initialize Card” button is pressed, the numbers must be appeared
on the cards.
The “Pick” button will be used to simulate picking a number from the bag. The picked number
must be shown. The number must be always different from the previous ones.
If the picked number is the same with one of the numbers in the player cards, you have to specify
it. This is left to the student and you can use different methods to do that.
You also must check the numbers in each row of the player cards after a number is picked. The
first player that completes one of the rows in its player card should take 10 points. This is called “The
First Bingo”. Then, the first player that completes two of the rows in its player card should take 20 points.
This is also called “The Second Bingo”. Then, the first player that completes all numbers in its player
card should take 40 points. You must show player’s score.
